# Cracking-The-Coding-Interview---Solutions
My own solutions to Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann

Note : 

I remember quite a few months ago that I was having a bit of trouble completing the IsUnique exercise. In fact, that was the only exercise that I did NOT complete it on my own but instead I referred to Gayle Laakmann's answer. Her implementation on using the ascii array to achieve O(n) time instead of O(n^2) sparked that "Ah-ha!" moment that I reused it in exercise 1.4 - PalindromePermutation.
